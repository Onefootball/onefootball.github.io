# Onefootball blog, notes to conributors

The website is accessible at https://onefootball.github.io/. It uses the GitHub Pages system to publish static pages generated with Jekyll. The installation and configuration has been done with that tutorial http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/.

## General structure of the project

  * All blog posts are in the `_posts/` directory. The naming pattern should be `YYYY-MM-DD-$title.md`.
  * If you want to tweek the theme, checkout the markup in `_layouts/` and the CSS/SASS in `_sass`
  * Images should be stored in `images/` and grouped by date (YYYY-MM).
  * Linking to images from a post is done with the `site.baseurl` variable: `![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2015-07/hacker.jpg)`
