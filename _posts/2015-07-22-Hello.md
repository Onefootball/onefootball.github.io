On the surface, [Onefootball](https://www.onefootball.com) is an awesome app for football fans to get their daily dose of news and scores wherever they are. But if you dig a bit deeper, you'll find that [Onefootball](http://www.onefootball.com/careers.html) is also a team of professionals solving challenges in many domains. One of those domains is software engineering and that's what this blog is about.

In our daily work, we make extensive use of the public code shared on the Internet and we produce our own to resolve new issues as well. In an effort to both present our more technical work and give back to the community, we decided to open that tech blog. We'll publish here announcements about our open-source projects, overviews of our tech stack, summaries of the conferences we attend, quick development tips and more in-depth articles concerning our processes.

We hope you'll enjoy reading our posts, feel free to contact us through the usual channels for feedback.
